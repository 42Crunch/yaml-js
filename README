A (partial) direct port of PyYAML (http://pyyaml.org/)

Currently only works with CommonJS (tested with NodeJS).

Likely to be extremely buggy just now for any non-trivial documents, as it's
only been tested with basic list/map structures.

Depends on:
  CoffeeScript (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
  underscore (http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)

Currently ported:
  Loading of default YAML structures to Javascript objects

Still to be ported:
  Serializing Javascript objects to YAML
  Loading serialized Javascript objects as a class instance, if available

Usage:

    yaml = require './src/yaml'
    yaml.load '''
              - just: write some
              - yaml:
                - [here, and]
                - {it: updates, in: real-time}
              '''
    ###
    [
      { just: 'write some' },
      {
        yaml: [
          [ 'here', 'and' ],
          { it: 'updates', in: 'real-time' }
        ]
      }
    ]
